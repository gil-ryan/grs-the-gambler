# HOW TO COUNT CARDS IN BLACKJACK

1.  Assign a tag of (+1) to every 2- 6 ranked cards and a tag of (â€“1) to every 10-A.
2. Start your count after the shuffle and add the tags to each card that is pulled from the deck.
3. When the running count is positive after any round, the undealt cards are richer in large cards; you should increase your bet size. 
4. When the running count is negative after any round, the undealt cards are richer in small cards; you should decrease your bet size. 
5. You will bet more money on positive counts, and less money on negative counts.
