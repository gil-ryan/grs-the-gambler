## The centre

It is well known that whatever side has control over the center, also has good prospects on both flanks. Just remember the number of square pieces can control from the center, compared to the corner. Pieces in the center can be easily transferred to any part of the board.

If an opoponent's piece is out of play, we take action on the opposite part of the board. Quite like real war, we should strike before the opponent has a chance to regroup. Furthermore, having centralized pieces allows us to prevent the opponent fromm centralizing their own, or from allowing them to undermine ours.
